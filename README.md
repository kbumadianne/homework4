# PyCity Schools Analysis

script to run: PyCitySchools_solution.ipynb

In this analysis we analyzed 15 different schools with varying district types, sizes and budget per student.  We calculated average math and reading scores, and % passing scores for math, reading and overall.  These scores and passing %s were calculated for total district, each school, each grade in each school, school spending ranges and school size. Conclusions from this analysis are:


--- Charter schools have a higher overall passing % at 90.4% vs District schools at 53.67%.  This Overall passing score in district schools is greatly falling below in the % Passing Math at 66.54%.This is further confirmed the in ranking of top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools.  All top 5 schools are Charter schools and all bottom 5 schools are District schools. 

--- At a grade level, the scores across grades within the same school seem to be fairly consistent.  There doesn't seem to be an issue where a certain grade at any given school is falling too far below the school average score for that corresponding subject score.
 
--- I ran a queries by school type on the school spending and school size dataframes at the bottoms of the notebook to understand how school size and per capita could potentially be impacting these results. The analysis shows that all District schools are large school sizes, this is impacting the student / teacher ratio meaning that the class sizes are higher in District schools.  The spending analysis shows that District schools on average have a higher spending per student.  I can conclude from this information that smaller class sizes are more important for overall school performance than the per school bud

--- This analysis leads me to believe that total school size is the largest determining success factor in the overall school performance# homework4
